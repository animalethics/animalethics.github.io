Katie founded Fetch Dog Training and Behavior in 2010, applying compassionate, evidence-based approaches to help dogs and their families succeed. She established Fetch-for-Fosters to address two key challenges in the field: rescue organizations' need for affordable training services and new trainers' need for hands-on experience. This program created a sustainable solution that served both groups while supporting dogs in need. She specialized in working with anxious, fearful, and aggressive dogs and their families. 

Her professional development includes certification as a Tierschutzqualifizierte Hundetrainerin (Animal Welfare Certified Dog Trainer) in Austria, along with internationally recogniCBCC-KA, CPDT-KA, and CBATI credentials. As a licensed Family Paws Parent Educator and Fear Free Professional, she contributed to the field through presentations at the Association of Professional Dog Trainers conference, Canine Science Forum, and Canine Science Conference. Her work has appeared in The Chronicle of the Dog and Animals scientific journal.

As an executive board member and curriculum writer for the Official Behavior Adjustment Training School, she helped develop educational standards for the industry. Her community involvement included work with the Behavior Crew at Foster My Pet, Peaceful Passing for Pets, and board positions with Minneapolis Animal Care and Control and the Twin Cities Obedience Training Club.

Currently, Katie serves as an animal ethicist, providing guidance to veterinarians, behaviorists, and caregivers working through decisions regarding behavioral euthanasia. This work combines her background in behavior with ethical frameworks to support both professionals and families during challenging situations.
